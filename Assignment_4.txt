ASSIGNMENT 4: Vowel Recognition
Prerequisite:
The below link provides you the sample test file of 320 samples. Apart from that four different files of Ai,s, Ci,s with hamming window, Ci's without hamming window, and Ri,s values are also provided. Calculate the Ai, Ci, and Ri values and validate them from the files.
Link: Vowel Recognition Files
For the vowel recognition assignment, you need to record several utterances of each vowel.
Procedure to be followed:
Record each vowel at least 20 times. 10 will be used for training and 10 for testing.
Trim your vowel part manually through Cooledit, keeping a little bit of silence before and after the vowel.
Name your recording properly.
Eg: RollNo_vowel_utteranceNo.txt
All of you must follow this naming convention. So if your roll number is 214XXXXXX, the vowel is u and the utter count is 7. Use 214XXXXXX_u_7.txt

Steps for vowel recognition:
Steps to generate reference file for 1 vowel
1) Take first vowel recording, do DC shift and normalization
2) Select 5 frames from the steady part.
3) Compute Ri's, Ai's, and Ci's of these frames and apply raised Sine window on Ci's
4) Repeat the above steps for 9 more recordings of the same vowel (so now you will have 50 rows of Ci values) and take the average of these recordings with respect to frames, i.e. frame 1 of all the 10 recordings should be considered for average and hence 10 rows will produce 1 row of Ci's. Similarly for all the frames, and so finally we will get 5 rows of Ci values (5 rows and 12 columns). Dump these values in a text file.
5)Similarly you will get a text file for the remaining 4 vowels and these 5 text files will be used as a reference file for vowels.
Now for testing:
1)Take input files for testing (10 test files per vowel) and pass these test files in a loop so that we can check out of 10 files how many are recognized correctly
2) for each test file take 5 frames from the stable part
3) Calculate Tokhura's distance from each reference file.
(Note: Since you have 5 stable frames and in each reference file you have 5 rows. So, Calculate the Tokhuraâ€™s distance with corresponding frames. Now, you have got 5 distances to take the average that will give you the final distance).
Similarly, do it with each reference file.
4) The one with minimum distance will be recognized as a vowel.
Please find the Tokhura weights:
1.0, 3.0, 7.0, 13.0, 19.0, 22.0, 25.0, 33.0, 42.0, 50.0, 56.0, 61.0
